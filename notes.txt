# When an hour changes, we've already confident that it's sandboxed
# within it's 12 part range.  It's true that if the change changes the
# Alarm hour (the GMT hour) from pm to am or vice versa, the effect
# does not change the displayed value, since by virtue of the sandbox,
# the resolved time will remain within the 12 part range.

# we have a gmt value of -5
# what's showing in the ui is 4(pm)
# what's in the database then is 21 ((gmt time + offset) gets us to 16, 
# which resolves to 4pm)
# in the ui, we change the value to 7(pm)
# the function must calculate the offset between old_displayed and
# new_displayed, then apply that offset to the gmt database time.
# In this case the new database time is 0(gmt)
#
# Conclusion: ampm field is useless in Alarm database.
#   Its only value is in calculating the 24 hour time of the hour
#   which is displayed at run-time.  If the hour is changed in the UI, 
#   then the result is concerned with flipping the 24 hour time of the
#   database only.
